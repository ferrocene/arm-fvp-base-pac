# Arm Base Fixed Virtual Platform Peripheral Access Crate

This crate provides peripheral access for the [Arm Fixed Virtual Platform](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Fixed%20Virtual%20Platforms),
**specifically for the Base platform FVPs**.

The implementation is based on [Fast Models Fixed Virtual Platforms Reference Guide Revision: 11.28](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100966/1128)
and [Fast Models Reference Guide Revision: 11.28](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100964/1128/).

## Implemented features

* Memory map description.
* `Peripherals` structure for obtaining individual peripherals while maintaining ownership.
* FVP power controller driver
* FVP system peripheral driver
* Re-exporting `arm-cci`, `arm-generic-timer`, `arm-gic`, `arm-pl011-uart` and `arm-sp805` drivers
  and common `safe-mmio` types. This enables projects to use these peripherals without adding these
  crates as explicit dependencies to the project. This also prevents having driver version conflicts
  in the project.

## Feature flags

* `base-revc`: Enables the Base Platform RevC-only MMIO regions and interrupt assignments.

## Limitations

* Not all peripherals are handled yet.

## License

The project is MIT and Apache-2.0 dual licensed, see `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT`.
